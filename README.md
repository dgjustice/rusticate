# Rust

Playing around with Rust and Piston (and some maths).

## Brensenham lines

`cargo run`

The code grabs mouse up and down events and draws lines between those points using the function in `lib.rs`.

### Issues

- Window resize doesn't work
- Attempt a line draw outside the window crashes
- No visible line while dragging
- WTF is up with those types?

## Bezier curve

WIP

### Issues

- no do it work

## Generic TODO

- For the love of mercy, use linear algebra
  - See previous point about types
